Experiment Description
Consider the situation of the previous exercises. That is: P preparation rooms, one operating theatre, and R recovery rooms with no intermediate buffer capacity between them. Assume still only one patient stream with exponentially distributed arrival and service times (means: interarrival time 25, preparation time 40, operation time 20, recovery time 40). (It is easy to infer that ideally, we should have 80% utilization of the operation room and on average less than two patients in preparation and recovery). For simplicity, we assume continuous operation. We shall monitor the building up of a queue before preparation, the idle capacity of the preparation, and the rate of blocking of operations.
Run 20 independent samples of 1000 time units of the system in equilibrium (some warm-up will be needed before monitoring the results). Do this for three different configurations (3 preparation rooms, 4 recoveries: 3p 5r, 4p 5r). (It may be wise to foresee the needs of all the problems at once to not have to rerun samples).
Observe the length of a queue before the preparation room and the probability of the operation being in a waiting state (blocked). You can do this by sampling the variables at a regular rate or by monitoring the variables exactly.
Compute the point estimates (means), and interval estimates (confidence intervals for means) for a 95% confidence level.
Do any of the observed values differ significantly between 3p5r and 4p5r or between 3p5r and 3p4r when treated as independent experiments and samples?
Arrange the simulation so that you can consider observations pairwise (using the same random number seeds for each configuration and considering the differences in observed values as independent observations). Compute the interval estimates directly for the differences. Are the differences between configurations now significant?
The blocking of the operation room is the most interesting quantity but its reliable estimation is difficult. As blocking can occur only when the operation ends while all recovery units are busy, consider observing the probability of all recovery units being busy. Does this have a smaller or larger (relative) confidence interval when you compare between different configurations?
As to your personal twist on the problem. Figure out a scenario where the twisted version would have the same expected overall utilization rate for the operation room and try to compare the original and twisted versions and see if they lead to a significantly different performance in the observed outputs. Most likely you will have to adjust the interarrival rate (and hence the total amount of clients) if your twist will affect the expected operation times (like when having severe cases in the mix).

Solution:
Simulation experiment details:
1. Simulation parameters:
time_units = 1000     # execution time of a single iteration
num_samples = 20      # simulation is repeated 20 times for each configuration to    collect sample data for subsequent statistical analysis.
warm_up_time = 150  # warm-up period after which we have to collect data 

2. Simulation Setup:
2.1 System Configuration: Define the setup with 3p4r, 3p5r, and 4p5r.
2.2 Exponential Distributions: Use exponentially distributed arrival and service times.
2.3 Time Units: Run 20 independent samples of 1000 time units for each configuration.
We have to generate 20 exponentially distributed arrival and service times based on                   the given mean values (means: interarrival time 25, preparation time 40, operation time 20, recovery time 40).  
For each configuration (3p4r, 3p5r and 4p5r), run the simulation program 20 times (with the random times generated in previous step) and collect observable data for each sample.

3. Monitoring Metrics:
3.1 Queue Length Before Preparation: Track the length of the queue before the preparation room. 
3.2 Operation Blocking Probability: Monitor the probability of the operation being in a waiting state (blocked). Blocking can occur only when the operation ends while all recovery units are busy. We can also observe the probability of all recovery units being busy. Steps:
Simulation Data Collection: During the simulation, monitor the operation theatre's state (busy/idle) and recovery rooms' occupancy. Whenever an operation finishes and all associated recovery rooms are occupied, count this as a blocking event.
Calculation of Blocking Probability: Sum up the total instances where an operation ends while all associated recovery rooms are busy (blocking events). 
 Blocking_probability=total number of blocking events total number of operations performed during the simulation.
(It can be calculated in different ways. Others can suggest.)

4. Statistical Analysis:
4.1 Point Estimates (Means): Compute means for observed values.
4.2 Confidence Intervals (95%) for Means: Calculate interval estimates for a 95% confidence level.
4.3 Comparative Analysis:
Analyze if observed values significantly differ between configurations.
Compute interval estimates directly for differences when considering configurations pairwise.
It's crucial to maintain consistency in random number seeds when comparing configurations pairwise to ensure independence in observations and accurate estimation of differences between setups.

Statistical Analysis Details:
1. Computing Point Estimates (Means):
Collect Sample Data: Use the simulation runs to gather data for queue lengths and operation blocking probabilities for each configuration.
Calculate Sample Mean: Compute the mean of each sample dataset for queue length and operation blocking probability separately for each configuration.
2. Computing Confidence Intervals for Means (95% Confidence Level):
Calculate Standard Error of the Mean (SEM):
Compute the standard deviation (SD) of the sample data.
Divide the SD by the square root of the sample size (number of simulation runs) to get the standard error.
For queue length and probability calculations, calculate SEM separately.
Compute Margin of Error (MoE): 
Multiply the SEM by the critical value from the t-distribution for a 95% confidence level (for 19 degrees of freedom if you have 20 samples). 
For 95% confidence level with 19 degrees of freedom, critical value = 2.093 (see the t table given below)

Calculate Confidence Intervals: 
Use the sample mean and the margin of error to calculate the confidence intervals around the means (Interval: mean ± MoE).
